//
// The gpio module provides functionality to interact with GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins on a Linux system.
// It includes a GPIO struct and methods to export and unexport the GPIO, set the mode to active low,
// write and read the GPIO value, and set the GPIO direction.
//
// The module is organized into several files:
//
// linuxgpio.go: This file defines the GPIO struct and its methods. The GPIO struct represents a GPIO pin with its properties.
//
// enums/GPIOMode.go: This file defines the GPIOMode type, which is used to set the direction of a GPIO pin.
//
// utils/KernelUtils.go: This file provides utility functions to interact with the Linux kernel's sysfs interface for GPIOs.
//
// utils/constants/general/Constants.go: This file defines constants used in the gpio module.
//
// go.mod: This file defines the module's dependencies.
//
// The gpio module uses the sysfs interface provided by the Linux kernel to interact with GPIO pins.
// The sysfs interface is a virtual file system provided by the Linux kernel that allows user space programs to interact with kernel objects.
// In the case of GPIOs, each GPIO pin is represented as a directory in the sysfs file system, and the properties of the GPIO pin can be read and written by reading and writing files in that directory.
//
// The gpio module provides a high-level interface to this sysfs interface, allowing the user to interact with GPIO pins using simple methods and properties, without needing to know the details of the sysfs interface.
